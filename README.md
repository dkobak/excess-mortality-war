## Data

This repository contains the following data requested directly from Rosstat:

* Number of deaths by federal region, year (1990 to 2023), age (5-year groups), and sex.
* Number of external deaths by year (2000 to 2022) and sex.
* Number of HIV deaths by year (2006 to 2023), age (1-year groups), and sex.

## Note on 2024 data

In June 2025 I requested the 2024 data but Rosstat [refused to provide it to me](https://kobak.livejournal.com/134458.html). All mortality data in Russia is now secret.
